The fact that these lesions have persisted for six months and are unresponsive to over-the-counter treatments is particularly significant. Given the age and gender of the patient, common conditions like psoriasis and eczema may be more prevalent. However, the description of the lesions being rough suggests a consideration for conditions like psoriasis, especially plaques, and perhaps even actinic keratosis if there is any sun exposure history. Contact dermatitis is less likely since the lesions are unresponsive to standard treatments, and lichen planus could also be a possibility given the location of the lesions. The social anxiety aspect points towards the potential psychological impact of a chronic skin condition. No previous medical history was mentioned, but the prominent symptoms and duration favor a diagnosis requiring dermatological intervention, like psoriasis or potentially lichen planus. Each potential diagnosis will guide our further evaluation, including perhaps a biopsy or specialized tests, depending on the response to initial treatments.",
